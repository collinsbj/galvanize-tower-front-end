## Galvanize Tower

In this project, you'll build a full-stack application that has an API, reads and writes data, and uses a library. The topic is up to you!

## Requirements

* Has an API that can list, read, update, create, and delete data
* Has a database backing that API that has at least 2 different tables
* Has a front-end that uses a application framework or component library that:
  * Consumes your API (list, read, update, create, and delete actions)
  * Uses some non-trivial (charting, mapping, payment, etc.) library
  * Has at least 2 end-to-end tests

Add a link to your [deployed front-end URL](https://galvanize-tower-front-end.herokuapp.com/), your [deployed API URL](https://galvanize-tower-back-end.herokuapp.com/), and any code repos you used[1](https://github.com/collinsbj/galvanize-tower-front-end)[2](https://github.com/collinsbj/galvanize-tower-back-end).
